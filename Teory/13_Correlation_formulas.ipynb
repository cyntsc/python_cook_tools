    "In 1885, **Sir Francis Galton** first defined the term \"regression\" and completed the theory of bivariate correlation. A decade later, **Karl Pearson** developed the index that we still use to measure correlation, **Pearson's r**. This article is written in recognition of the 100th anniversary of Galton's first\n",
    "discussion of regression and correlation. <br>\n",
    "They present 13 different formulas, each of which represents a different computational and conceptual definition of **r**. Each formula suggests a different way of thinking about this index, from algebraic, geometric, and\n",
    "trigonometric settings. We show that **Pearson's r** (or simple functions of r) may variously be thought of as a special type of mean, a special type of variance, the ratio of two means, the ratio of two variances, the slope of a line, the cosine of an angle, and the tangent to an ellipse, and may be looked at from several other interesting perspectives. <br>\n",
    "Galton's original work on the correlation was motivated by a very specific **biometric problem**. It is remarkable that such a focused effort would lead to the development of what is perhaps the most broadly applied index in all of statistics. <br>\n",
